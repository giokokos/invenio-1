Git Workflow
============

This page describes the Git collaboration workflow that we try to
follow in our development.

Introduction
------------

Our collaboration model is basically a pull-on-demand model similar to
the one used for the Linux kernel.  You may want to read a chapter in the
`Mercurial book on this collaboration model <http://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/collaborating-with-other-people.html>`_.

In the recipes below you will encounter several personas with
different roles:

* Joe Bloggs, head developer and system integrator
* John Doe, developer, maintainer of module *WebFoo*
* Erika Mustermann, developer, maintainer of module *WebBar*


Setting up things
-----------------

S1. Setting up your Git identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How to set up your Git identity::

    $ vim ~/.gitconfig
    $ cat ~/.gitconfig
    [alias]
        k = log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
    [user]
        email = john.doe@cern.ch
        name = John Doe
    [color]
        ui = auto


Please use the same full name and email address that was used in the
good old CVS !ChangeLog, so that the repo history looks nicely
coherent over time.

S2. Setting up your private repo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is how to set up your private repo (on your laptop)::

    $ cd ~/src
    $ git clone http://invenio-software.org/repo/invenio.git


=== S3. Backuping your private repo (only developers at CERN)===

This is how to mirror your private repo to CERN AFS space::

    $ rsync -rlptDvz -e ssh --delete ~/src/invenio/ \
    johndoe@lxplus.cern.ch:private/src/invenio


You should mirror your private repo and your working files from your
laptop to your private AFS space every night or so.  This will give
you a safety of having AFS backups around should something bad happen
to your laptop.  This is important, because you may have some features
existing only in your personal repo for weeks or months (see below).

Also, having a mirror of your private repo on AFS will provide you
with an easy way of testing your private uncommitted code on various
other machines, notably CDSDEV.

S4. Setting up your public repo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is how to set up your public repo (on your AFS public space)::

    $ ssh johndoe@lxplus.cern.ch # LXPLUS (SLC5) now has git
    johndoe@lxplus> mkdir /afs/cern.ch/user/j/johndoe/public/repo
    johndoe@lxplus> cd /afs/cern.ch/user/j/johndoe/public/repo
    johndoe@lxplus> mkdir invenio-johndoe.git
    johndoe@lxplus> cd invenio-johndoe.git
    johndoe@lxplus> git --bare init
    johndoe@lxplus> chmod a+rx hooks/post-update
    johndoe@lxplus> echo "John Doe's personal tree." > description


You can now push your private master branch (from your laptop) to your
public repo (on AFS)::

    $ cd ~/src/invenio
    $ git push ssh://johndoe@lxplus.cern.ch/~/public/repo/invenio-johndoe.git master


You can define a shortcut called ``johndoe-public`` for your public repo
in order to ease future push commands::

    $ git remote add johndoe-public \
        ssh://johndoe@lxplus.cern.ch/~/public/repo/invenio-johndoe.git
    $ git push johndoe-public master


S5. Pushing to your public repo from outside CERN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to be able to push to your public repo from outside of CERN
to a specific machine such as cdswaredev that has ssh port hidden
behind the firewall, you should configure your ssh client to connect
to cdswaredev via lxplus proxy gateway, using netcat to forward
traffic to cdswaredev::

    $ cat ~/.ssh/config
    Host lxplus.cern.ch
        ProxyCommand ssh lxplus.cern.ch exec /usr/bin/nc %h %p


This will enable you to have apparently direct ssh/scp/git command
connection from your laptop to cdsware, as if you were inside CERN.

Note that this is not needed for regular branch pushing, since LXPLUS
now has git.  It is only needed to access git repos on specific
machines, which is rarely the typical developer use case.

S6. Making your public repo visible on the Web
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please contact Joe Bloggs in order to make your public repo visible on
Invenio's `repo web interface <http://invenio-software.org/repo/>`_.

S7. Using remote repository locally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you prefer, you can mount the remote afs filesystem in the local drive,  and work
as normal. To accomplish that you need sshfs package installed::

    mkdir ~/afsrepo
    sshfs -o workaround=rename <username>@lxplus.cern.ch:/afs/cern.ch/user/r/<username>/public/repo ~/afsrepo/
    git push ~/afsrepo/invenio.git/ master


To unmount the repository::

    fusermount -u ~/afsrepo


You can create aliases or edit /etc/fstab to help you mount the public repository.

    sshfs#<USERNAME>@lxplus.cern.ch:/afs/cern.ch/user/<LETTER>/<USERNAME>/public/repo fuse user,noauto 0 0


Understanding official repo branches
------------------------------------

The official Invenio repository contains several branches for
maintenance and development purposes.  We roughly follow the usual git
model as described in
`man 7 gitworkflows <http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitworkflows.html>`_
and elsewhere.

In summary, the new patchlevel releases (X.Y.Z) happen from the
``maint`` branch, the new minor feature releases (X.Y) happen from the
``master`` branch, and new major feature releases (X) happen after they
mature in the ``next`` branch.  A more detailed description follows.

**maint**

This is the maintenance branch for the latest stable release.  There
can be several maintenance branches for every release series
(**maint-0.99**, **maint-1.0**, **maint-1.1**), but typically we use only
``maint`` for the latest stable release.

The code that goes to the maintenance branch is of the bugfix nature
only.  It should not alter DB table schema, Invenio config file
schema, local configurations in the ``etc`` folder, or template function
parameters in a backward-incompatible way.  If it contains any new
features, then they are switched off in order to be fully compatible
with the previous releases in this series.  Therefore, for
installations using any Invenio released X.Y series, it should be
always safe to upgrade the system at any moment in time by (1) backing
up their ``etc`` folder containing local configuration, (2) installing
the corresponding ``maint-X.Y`` branch updates, and (3) rolling back the
``etc`` folder with their customizations.  This upgrade process will be
automatized in the future via special ``inveniocfg`` options.

**master**

The ``master`` branch is where the new features are being developed and
where the new feature releases are being made from.  The code in
``master`` is reviewed and verified, so that it should be possible to
make a new release out of this branch almost at any given point in
time.  However, Invenio installations that would like to track this
branch should be aware that DB table definitions are not frozen and
may change, the config is not frozen and may change, etc, until the
release time.  So while ``master`` is relatively stable for usage, it
should be treated with extreme care, because updates between day D1
and day D2 may require DB schema and ``etc`` configuration changes that
are not covered by usual ``inveniocfg`` update statements, so people
should be prepared to study the differences and update DB schemata and
config files themselves.

**next**

If a new feature is well implemented, tested and considered stable, it
goes directly into the ``master`` branch described previously.  If it is
cleaned, tested and almost stable, but not fully ``master`` worthy yet,
then it may go to the ``next`` branch.  The ``next`` branch serves as a
kind of stabilization branch for ``master``.  The features may stay in
``next`` for a long enough time so as to gets stabilized, and when they
are ready, they are promoted to ``master`` (or to ``maint`` in some
scenarios).  The code in ``next`` may have bugs, may not pass the test
suite, but anyway should be stable enough so that it is almost never
revoked/rebased.

Usually, ``master`` contains all of ``maint``, and ``next`` contains all of
``master``.  This is assured by periodical upward merges
(maint-to-master, master-to-next, etc).

== Working on new features - overview ==

Here is a schema summarizing how John Doe would work on new features
and fixes, and how Joe Bloggs would integrate them.

[[Image(invenio-git-workflow.png, 859px)]]

The most important thing to recall is that *any topic branch*, be it a
bugfix or a new feature, *should be started off by the developer from the lowest maint branch it applies to*,
since it will then be merged upwards to all the other branches as part
of the integration process.

[[Image(invenio-git-branches.png, 348px)]]

Example: if there is an important bug in v0.99.1 that John is going to
fix, then John should create a topic branch from the tip of
``maint-0.99``, test and everything, and send it over for integration,
and it will then get merged both to ``maint-0.99`` as well as to all the
necessary upwards branches (``maint-1.0``, ``maint-1.1``, ``master``, etc),
as needed, e.g. via periodical ``maint->master`` merges.

Backporting fixes from ``master`` to ``maint`` should remain exceptional.

== Working on new features - details ==

W1. Cloning the repo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you clone the official repo (see S2 above), you keep working on
your laptop in your own private git repo, using Atlantis Institute of
Fictive Science setup conditions.

W2. Working with local topic branches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You never work on the master branch, you always checkout local *topic
branches* for every feature you are implementing.  This will permit
you to switch between topics easily, implement some urgent fixes for
older releases, publishing some features while retaining features not
yet ready for public eyes, etc.

In our workflow example above, we created several branches to tackle
several different tasks::

    $ git checkout master
    $ git branch new-feature-a
    $ git branch new-feature-b
    $ git branch refactor-c
    $ git checkout next
    $ git branch wild-idea-d
    $ git checkout maint
    $ git branch bugfix-e


The topical branches do not necessarily have to stem from the same
point in the master branch.

Please name your topical branches sensibly, since their names may
appear in the central repo logs in case of non-trivial merges.
(Please use a dash rather than underscore in topical branch names.)

W3. Working on new-feature-b
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You now have some time to work on feature B, so::

    $ git checkout new-feature-b
    [ edit, test, edit, test, commit ]
    [ edit, test, edit, test, commit ]
    [ more of the same ]


until things work as they should for the Atlantis Institute of Fictive
Science demo site.  This can take a minute or a few weeks, depending
on the complexity of B.

While working on B, you can switch to other branches to work on
various more urgent problems, etc.

W4. Using temporary stash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to switch branches, then you have to commit all the
stuff you are currently editing, which may not be what you want.  In
that case you can **stash** your commits into a temporary git stash,
switch to a branch, do what you want, and when you come back, replay
the changes from the stash.  Here is an example::

    $ git stash # put local edits to the stash
    $ git stash list # list what you have there
    stash@`informe 0 <report/0>`_: WIP on foo.py: 2340b5a... WebFoo: new support for baz
    $ git checkout refactor-c # work on the refactor-c branch a bit
    `... <...>`_
    $ git checkout new-feature-b  # come back to the new-feature-b branch
    $ git stash apply # replay stuff from stash
    $ git diff # verify


W5. Testing on DEV servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When your new-feature-b code works okay on the demo site, and you
synced it to your /private/ AFS space, you should now test it under
**CDSDEV** or **INSPIREDEV** operating conditions.  Some more editing,
testing, and committing may be needed if things are not working as
expected.

If the code is working properly on CDSDEV in itself, but say some
scalability issues were encountered, then there are two options: (i)
either some more of the editing/testing/committing cycle is needed, or
(ii) the code is considered working fine enough to be merged now,
while the performance issues are savannized to be solved later.

W6. Rebasing against latest git/master
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this step the new-feature-b code is working both for Atlantis
and for CDS contexts.  You should now check official repo for any
updates to catch any changes that may have been committed to
origin/master in the meantime::

    $ git checkout master
    $ git pull


You can then **rebase** your new-feature-b branch again recent master::

    $ git checkout new-feature-b
    $ git rebase master


In case of conflicts during the rebase, say in file foo.py, you should
resolve them::

    $ vim foo.py
    $ git add foo.py
    $ git rebase --continue


or you can stop the rebase for good::

    $ git rebase --abort


You may prefer rebasing of your local commits rather than merging, so
that the project log looks nice.  (No ugly empty merge commits, no
unnecessary temporary versions.)

While rebasing, you may want to squash your commits together, to keep
the git repo history clean.  See section R4 below for more details.

You should test your code once more to see if it was not broken by
updates.

W7. Publishing your work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

W7.a Pushing into your public repo
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The new-feature-b code is now ready to be pushed into your
**public repo** for public consumption.  Please make sure to check again
that the test cases are working well, and please check once more the
basic code kwalitee, as mentioned in the section R3 below.

If the test cases work and the code kwalitee is acceptable, then push
your branch into your public repo like this::

    $ git push johndoe-public new-feature-b


Then alert Joe Bloggs with a request to review and integrate the
branch, indicating ``git branch johndoe/new-feature-b`` in the email
Subject header so that the emails will be threaded properly and given
special treatment in the haystack of Joe's usual email conversation.
Please also add any special observations for merge.  Example::

    From: john.doe@cern.ch
    To: joe.bloggs@cern.ch
    Subject: git branch johndoe/new-feature-b

    Hi Joe:

    Please merge git branch johndoe/new-feature-b.  Tests added,
    kwalitee checked, needed quickly for Jane's forthcoming
    new-feature-c.

    Cheers, John Doe



W7.b Sending patches by email
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If some occasional code contributors do not have a public repo, they
can generate and **send patches by email** to Joe.  Say like this::

    $ git checkout master
    $ git pull
    $ git branch foo-fix
    $ git checkout foo-fix
    $ emacs bar.py
    $ git commit -a -m 'WebFoo: fixed bad problem'
    $ git format-patch master
    $ ls -l 0001-WebFoo-fixed-bad-problem.patch
    $ git send-email --to joe.bloggs@cern.ch 0001-WebFoo-fixed-bad-problem.patch


Or, instead of the last command, send Joe a normal verbose email with
attached ``0001-WebFoo-fixed-bad-problem.patch`` file.

W7.c Sending patch-suggestions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As we said in the introduction, John usually maintains module !WebFoo
while Erika usually maintains module !WebBar.  What happens if Erika
spots a problem some !WebFoo feature?

If the problem is clear, and its solution is clear, then Erika can
simply alert John that she's up to it, fix the problem and publish a
branch or send an email to Joe asking for integration.

If the problem a little bit more convoluted, or there are several
possible solutions and it is not clear which one is the best, or the
solution to the problem requires some deep changes inside !WebFoo
structures that may affect other things, or the problem requires
optimizations of several pre-existing functions, then it may be best
if Erika contacts John as the !WebFoo module maintainer about the
problem.  Maybe John would like to do the changes himself, or John can
advise Erika how to go about the problem, etc.

In the latter case Erika can implemented proposed solution and send
the patch-suggestion email to John as explained in W7.b.  John can
than review and okay the change and eventually change what has to be
change and forward the branch to Joe for integration.

Note that if such a change to !WebFoo may affect other modules and/or
other APIs, then these have to be usually discussed/reviewed by Joe in
advance, as the other intra-module vs inter-module questions.

W8. Review process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

W8.a Reviewing and merging branches
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Joe now starts to **review and integrate** the new-feature-b branch.
This usually takes two rounds: 1) pure reading of the patch can
generate some comments; after the round one is over, 2) testing of the
patch can generate other comments.

If the changes to be done are rather small, then Joe usually does it
himself::

    $ git log master..johndoe/new-feature-b # even when master is well ahead in future
    $ git diff master...johndoe/new-feature-b
    $ git merge --log johndoe/new-feature-b
    $ git commit --amend # change log message
    $ vim Makefile.am # edit to fix something
    $ git add Makefile.am
    $ git commit --amend -s # commit also this new change and sign-off
    $ git push origin-writable master # push to public repo


If the changes to be done are rather important, and may reveal a
necessity to make some more amendments to the code, this can lead
eventually to some more lengthy edit/test/commit iterations done in
your private repos.  If this happens, then, since your code was
already published into a public space (even though as personal only),
you should not rebase anymore (since rebase rewrites history); you
should only merge your new amendments.  Or, in case of bigger
rewrites, you can publish a new branch.

W8.b Reviewing and committing patches
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For patches received by email, similar review procedure takes
place.  To integrate such a patch::

    $ less ~/0001-Foo.patch
    $ emacs ~/0001-Foo.patch # for small edits
    $ git am -3 ~/0001-Foo.patch
    $ git commit --amend # to change commit message


or, for bigger patches that may require more integration work::

    $ less ~/0001-Foo.patch
    $ git am -3 ~/0001-Foo.patch
    $ emacs foo.py # change what is needed
    $ emacs bar.py # change what is needed
    # test, install, etc
    $ git add foo.py # add silently Joe's changes to original patch
    $ git add bar.py # add silently Joe's changes to original patch
    $ git commit --amend # commit everything in John's name


Although the last process may be evil at times, since Joe kind of
usurps John's name for the changes, and commits in this name.  Hence
this method is usually acceptable for tiny commits only
(e.g. correcting typos).

W8.c Reviewing and cherry-picking commits
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Instead of integrating branches in full, Joe may want to **cherry-pick**
some particular commits, or squash branches to keep nice project
history.  An example::

    # see log of a branch:
    $ git log erika/cool-stuff
    # pick one particular commit: (e.g. some other author in Erika's branch)
    $ git cherry-pick 027e1524cd1b823a620620d4b60dd570596fd641
    # edit its log message:
    $ git commit --amend
    # squash other commits together while merging: (e.g. other author in Erika's branch)
    $ git diff 027e1524cd1b823a620620d4b60dd570596fd641 394d1a2a8488cbd0554f12b627ce478c8d1ee65c > ~/z.patch
    $ git apply --check z.patch
    $ git apply ~/z.patch --check # test whether patch applies
    $ emacs ~/z.patch # edit some lines away, retest until applies
    $ git apply --reject z.patch # alternatively, apply only good junks, study rejects later
    # commit changes as Erika:
    $ git commit -a --author='Erika Mustermann <erika.mustermann@cern.ch>'


W9. Checking integrated branch
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Once all the integration-related iterations are over, and your
new-feature-b code was integrated into the Invenio master branch,
then you fetch it to **check** if it was well integrated, and you delete
your new-feature-b branch since you don't need it anymore::

    $ git checkout master
    $ git pull
    $ git diff master..new-feature-b
    $ git branch -d new-feature-b


If Joe editing something during merge, then the commit SHA1s may not
match, but you would notice and study differences offered by diff.

W10. Deleting integrated branch
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Once new-feature-b is fully okay, you **delete** this branch in your
public repo::

    $ git push johndoe-public :new-feature-b


Remarks often made during code review
-------------------------------------

R1. Remarks on commit history
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before a topical branch is sent for review and integration, the commit
history of the branch should be checked and eventually polished.  Here
is an example.

Consider a topical branch with history like this::


    commit1 WebFoo: new xyzzy facility
    commit2 WebFoo: fixed typo
    commit3 WebFoo: speed-ups for xyzzy daemon
    commit4 WebFoo: Python-2.4 compatibility
    commit5 WebFoo: Friday weekly cleanup
    commit6 WebFoo: even more speed ups
    commit7 WebFoo: oops, cleaned documention
    commit8 WebFoo: amendments of zyxxy


This is not too good.  While preserving full commit history in the git
repository would be nice, the problem here is that historical versions
of the xyzzy facility in the topical branch are not always working
properly.  The whoops commits are not eliminated.  Keeping
intermediary commits does not make sense if they are not working
properly, they would only be making `git bisect` harder in the future.

Ideally, the individual commits should be in an always-working state,
and they should be presented in logical groups.  For example the above
branch is better to be squashed as follows::


    commit1 WebFoo: new xyzzy facility
     + commit2 WebFoo: fixed typo
     + commit4 WebFoo: Python-2.4 compatibility
     + commit7a WebFoo: oops, cleaned documention
    commit3 WebFoo: speed-ups for xyzzy daemon
     + commit5 WebFoo: Friday weekly cleanup
     + commit7b WebFoo: oops, cleaned documention
    commit6 WebFoo: even more speed ups
     + commit7c WebFoo: oops, cleaned documention
    commit8 WebFoo: amendments of zyxxy


That is, the initial commit should be without typos and syntax errors,
should be working on Python-2.4 environment already, and should
contain respective documentation already.  The speed optimisation is
an independent improvement, so this would logically constitute our
second commit.  If the commit6 contained documentation bits about
optimisations, the should be presented here.  The same is true for the
next even-more-speedups commit.  Finally, feature amendments come the
last.

Git has powerful tools to help cleaning topical branches like this.
Notably, you can run `git rebase master -i` to squash/reorder commits,
`git gui` to separate various hunks inside commits, etc.

Here is an illustration of a typical thinking process during branch
clean ups:


* Is the facility fully working now as expected?  If yes, keep the
   commit.


* Is this facility or some related one broken in one of the aspects?
   If yes, amend and squash.


* Is this commit an improvement over an already-working facility?  If
   yes, keep the commit.


* Is this commit intermediary?  Is it worth keeping?  Is there a
   chance that somebody might want to start off a new branch at this
   point in some day?  Does this commit helps some future developer to
   better understand the branch history?  If not, squash.


* Is the primary author of this commit different?  If yes, keep the
   commit.  Or squash but use `Co-authored-by` commit log directive.


* Is the same commit addressing more than one logically separate problem?
   If yes, split.

Having clean branch history helps in providing sensibly working atomic
updates, helps in understanding commits and code, eases eventual
future bug-hunting via git bisecting, and makes the software generally
more robust.

R2. Remarks on commit log messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

R2a. Commit message format
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Invenio git commit log messages are usually formatted in the following
way:

* commit message headline providing short summary (up to about 50 chars) formatted in the style of `ModuleName: short description`. (using mostly nouns, no verbs)

* empty line

* commit message body with detailed description of what this patch does, formatted as a bulletted list. (using present tense)

Here is an example: changeset:b98f24bf38b95dd7366d57e8d6d90804957099e5::

    BibDocFile: additional mimetypes support


    * Introduces new CFG_BIBDOCFILE_ADDITIONAL_KNOWN_MIMETYPES config
      variable to be able to recognize new mimetypes from a given file
      extension (useful in case an old mimetypes Python module is used).


Note that if you use `vim` or `emacs git-modes` to write your commit
messages, you will be alerted about the excessive headline length
(more than 50 characters) via colour syntax highlighting.

The short commit logs are easily readable on narrow mobile devices,
are helpful to quickly localise features, and ease any possible
hunting for bugs via git bisecting later should the troubles arise.

Here is an example listing last 15 commits on the master branch::

    $ git log -n 15 maint-1.1..master --pretty=oneline | grep -v 'Merge b'
    c7cd1f184188207b55903e00e78e5b1acbff33c3 BibFormat: author links for mobile app
    6f0641cbde7866adc521793e434f77e2d842f40e WebSearch: display number of hits in mobile output
    be86ab82f632c60aea7dfc10677f091104155a86 BibFormat: initial release of mobile app formats

    b18ee3fd919c1a06b143761f4611c02f4ac91cab BibField: Python-2.4 compatibility fix


See also commit message practices used in the git world, such as
`here <http://spheredev.org/wiki/Git_for_the_lazy#Writing_good_commit_messages>`_ and
`here <http://www.tpope.net/node/106>`_.

R2b. Commit message QA/review directives
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The authors can use the following commit signature directives in order
to highlight the quality of the patch at hand before requesting its
review and merge.

Example:  changeset:e4a1804b7bbdf61f2b7fe8698684c16aced3f58a::

Here is the list of QA directives that the author may use:

  Reported-by::
    Acknowledges the user who originally reported the bug that this commit fixes.

  Signed-off-by::
    The author says, in essence: "I have carefully implemented the feature without any leftover to-be-fixed places, I have run all code kwalitee checks and all relevant unit and functional tests, and everything is good.  To the best of my knowledge, this commit is good to go into the fast merge track".

  Co-authored-by::
    Used when more persons than the current author were involved in creating the code.  This usually happens in peer programming.

  Improved-by::
    Acknowledges the person who improved the current code significantly after the original committer left, say.  This differs from review in that the author provides much more improvements than in a usual review.

The reviewers then usually add one of the following tags:

  Acked-by::
    The reviewer says, in essence: "I have seen this commit from a distance while walking in the corridor, it looks useful, but I have not had time to deal with it further".  Rarely used.

  Tested-by::
    The reviewer says, in essence: "In addition, I have paged through the code, tested its kwalitee, tested the desired functionality that this commit implements, and all is well."

  Reviewed-by::
    The reviewer says, in essence: "In addition, I have read every line of the source code in detail."

Note that a similar system is used in the git world, e.g. Linux kernel
`https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches>`_ or Git
itself
`http://git.kernel.org/cgit/git/git.git/plain/Documentation/SubmittingPatches <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/git/git.git/plain/Documentation/SubmittingPatches>`_.
While we use some tags in similar context, some other tags we use
slightly differently.

R2c. Commit message ticket directives
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If the commit addresses a certain problem or implements a certain
feature that has been previously ticketised in the Invenio ticket
tracking system, then the commit should contain a ticket directive.

Example: changeset:b18ee3fd919c1a06b143761f4611c02f4ac91cab::

    BibField: Python-2.4 compatibility fix

    * Fixes Python-2.4 compatibility problem.  (closes `ticket 1533 <ticket/1533>`_)

    * Also standardizes the use of double quotes arrounf XML atributes.

The `(closes `ticket 1533 <ticket/1533>`_)` directive will cause the Trac ticket 1533 to be
automatically closed when the patch will be pushed to the official
repository by the Lead Developer.  There is no need to manipulate the
ticket status on Trac manually.  (There should never be such a need.)

Here is the list of all available ticket directives the authors may
use in the commit messages:

  `(closes `ticket 123 <ticket/123>`_)`::
     This commit fully closes ticket 123.

  `(addresses `ticket 123 <ticket/123>`_)`::
     This commit addresses, but not fully closes yet, ticket 123.

  `(references `ticket 123 <ticket/123>`_)`::
     This commit references ticket 123.

R3. Remarks on the coding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a small sample of often-made coding remarks:


* Compliance to our `coding standards <http://invenio-demo.cern.ch/help/hacking/coding-style>`_.  Stick to PEP 8, run ``pylint`` often.
* Missing `test cases <http://invenio-demo.cern.ch/help/hacking/test-suite>`_.
* Sanitisation of input variables.  Default value check, XSS.
* Proper escaping of HTML output.  Use ``cgi.escape()``.
* Proper ``run_sql()`` argument quoting.  SQL injection.
* Compliance to Python 2.3. Test on SLC4.

Ideally you should make sure they are not present in your public
branches before asking for merge into the git/master.  You can do a
**code kwalitee** check yourself by running::

    $ cd src/invenio/modules/bibedit/lib
    ... hack on bibrecord_engine.py and friends
    ... make install etc until satisfaction
    $ python ../../miscutil/lib/kwalitee.py --check-all ./bibrecord*.py


and then follow the output recommendations.  (If =--check-all= is too
troublesome to implement e.g. due to bad legacy code, then please fix
at least the recommendations produced by running =--check-some=.)

For more information on the code kwalitee checking, on the
above-listed problems and on ways how to solve them, as well as some
other frequently made remarks on the coding, please see the dedicated
InvenioQualityAssurances wiki page.

R4. Notes on the review process timeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our pull-on-demand collaboration model enables us to have a *clean*
development version of Invenio - there are not anymore problems with
the CVS HEAD being broken because people were committing things before
checking etc.

The price for the inherent review process in the pull-on-demand
collaboration model is a certain time delay before the code becomes
published and visible.  It is normal for John and Erika to have many
branches sitting around, waiting for Joe to integrate them.  The
integration delay can very depending on the complexity of the branch.

E.g. it helps to check in advance the list of frequent remarks
mentioned in the section R3 above.

E.g. it helps to provide test cases for every bigger commit.
(Especially for deep changes that may affect lots of the codebase, not
mentioning changes affecting inter-module relationships.)

E.g. if does not help if a branch combines several different features
together.  We should not mix feature A and feature B together in the
same commit and/or branch that implements some new feature C.  It is
always better to separate different features into different topical
branches.  On the other hand, it may not be good to separate too much,
if features A and B are clearly logically linked.  The common sense
will tell how much separation is needed.  (Similarly to how the common
sense says when to stop the database design normalization process.)
